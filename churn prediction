Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses, especially in industries like telecommunications, where customer retention is key to long-term success. In this report, we present the findings and insights from our churn prediction project using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that can identify at-risk customers and provide valuable insights for proactive customer retention strategies.

Introduction: The objective of this project was to leverage machine learning, specifically MLP neural networks, to create a robust churn prediction model. By understanding and predicting customer churn, businesses can minimize the negative impact of customer attrition and take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

Data Preparation: The first step in the project involved gathering relevant data from the telecommunications industry, including customer demographic information, usage patterns, customer service interactions, and historical churn records. The data was rigorously preprocessed and engineered to ensure its suitability for training an MLP model.

Modeling and Analysis: The MLP neural network was utilized to build the churn prediction model. The model underwent training using the prepared dataset, with a focus on optimizing its ability to identify customer churn based on various input features. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were employed to enhance the model's predictive performance.

Evaluation and Results: The performance of the MLP churn prediction model was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results demonstrated the model's ability to effectively identify at-risk customers and forecast churn with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.

Business Implications: The insights generated by the MLP churn prediction model have significant business implications. By proactively identifying at-risk customers, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies, personalized customer engagement initiatives, and loyalty programs aimed at reducing churn rates and increasing customer satisfaction.
